# Brain Tumors MRI Project for Advanced Medical Research:
- Brain Tumor Classification using Tensorflow framework with classification model

# Dataset:
This dataset is taken from publicly available dataset on Kaggle. It consists of four classes, including three tumor classes (Pituitary, Glioma and Meningioma) and there is another class which represents normal brain MRI scans.

1. Glioma Tumor
2. Meningioma Tumor
3. Pituitary Tumor
4. No Tumor/ Normal

# Frameworks:
Tensor Flow

# Models:
The following model used to classify Brain Tumor: MobileNetV2

# Results:
We have found the result of training loss, validation loss, training accuracy, validation accuracy etc.
